First of all,
Welcome to Alaria city.
There's a huge abyss down there,
and many adventurers explore it,
but no one ever found the
deepest part.
I'll teach you the basics :
Press Enter to talk to someone !
Check your current quests
the top left of the screen !
Press Escape to open the menu.
You can go in the skill tree to gain
new skills with skill points (SP).
The status menu gives you your stats:
Life, Strength, Armor,
Precision, Speed, and Luck !
Gain experience in the abyss
to get stronger !
See you later !

Nevermind, have fun !
